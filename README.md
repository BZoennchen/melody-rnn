This repository contains code highly inspired by Valerio Velardo tutorial. His code can be found [here](https://github.com/musikalkemist/generating-melodies-with-rnn-lstm/tree/master/9%20-%20Converting%20Generated%20Melodies%20to%20MIDI).
And his YouTube-channel can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/@ValerioVelardoTheSoundofAI).
I just addad OSC communication to communicate with [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).

Requirements:
